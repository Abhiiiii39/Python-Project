# Python-Project
In this project, a dataset related to supply chain operations was analyzed and processed using Python and various libraries such as Pandas and scikit-learn. The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values in the "Quantity," "Cost_Per_Unit," and "Total_Cost" columns by replacing them with their respective means. The data was then split into features (X) and target variable (y) with the goal of predicting the "Total_Cost." A linear regression model was applied to train on 80% of the data and predict "Total_Cost" for the remaining 20% (test set). The model's performance was evaluated, and a prediction was made for a sample input of [899, 718] using the trained model. The project demonstrates how to preprocess data, build a regression model, and make predictions in a supply chain context.
