# Supply Chain Cost Prediction using Linear Regression
In this project, a dataset related to supply chain operations was analyzed and processed using Python and various libraries such as Pandas and scikit-learn. The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values in the "Quantity," "Cost_Per_Unit," and "Total_Cost" columns by replacing them with their respective means. The data was then split into features (X) and target variable (y) with the goal of predicting the "Total_Cost." A linear regression model was applied to train on 80% of the data and predict "Total_Cost" for the remaining 20% (test set). The model's performance was evaluated, and a prediction was made for a sample input of [899, 718] using the trained model. The project demonstrates how to preprocess data, build a regression model, and make predictions in a supply chain context.
# Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression
Developed a heart disease prediction model using logistic regression on a dataset to classify whether a patient has heart disease. The data was preprocessed by handling missing values and splitting it into training and test sets. The model was trained on the training set and evaluated using a confusion matrix, achieving an accuracy score. The trained model was saved and later used to make predictions on new data. The project showcases the application of machine learning for medical diagnostics, enabling heart disease risk prediction.
